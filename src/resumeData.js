    "aboutme":"I'm a Data Engineer who aspires to work in the cybersecurity industry. As someone with a processing disorder, I have achieved things greater than I thought possible, only realising my disorder was not a hindrance when I co-authored my first publication in psychology. Following my goal to become an engineer, I found a passion to build, learn and apply my skills in creative and innovative ways. I believe this will allow me to create a greater future for everyone. Until now, I have had the opportunity to work in a business-orientated role as a strategy and analytics coordinator and a technical role as a software developer. I've contributed to various not-for-profit organisations over my life and have held the position of treasurer for the Programmers' Society (ProgSoc) at UTS. With experience in such diverse roles, I can confidently say that data has the ability to change the world for the better. While my journey as a professional in the ever-evolving world of data and technology has just begun, I hope you'll reach out or follow me on my exciting journey.",
